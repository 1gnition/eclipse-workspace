Caching
-------

1.	There is level of cache which is enabled by default in Hibernate. This is the first level cache.
	This cache is actually implemented as part of the Session class.
	For example: when a session.get() is called twice, Hibernate won't issue another select operation.
2.	This caching won't be effective if we closed the session. If we open a new session all the cached data
	is lost. This is the motivation for second-level caching.
3.	There are three types of second-level cache:
	3.1.	Across sessions in the same application
	3.2.	Across sessions in different applcations
	3.3.	Across clusters
