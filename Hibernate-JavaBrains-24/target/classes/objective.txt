1.	Consider a scenario where you get an object from the database, present it to the user,
	and then wait for user input to change the object.
	The user input can take a long time so you close the session meanwhile.
	Now the object is detached. When the user input comes, you want to update
	the entity in the database, so now you need the object to be persistent again.
	detached ---> persistent.
