Hibernate is an ORM framework
Compliant with JPA

Motivation
----------
We normally use JDBC and manually map Java objects to SQL tables
1.	Mapping member variables to columns
	* Need to write boilerplate code.
	* Every time we change the data (i.e. add a column), we have to change the code.
2.	Need to handle relationships
	* Create primary keys and mapping them to foreign keys
3.	Data types of databases do not match Java data types.
	* Need to handle this manually.
4.	Managing object state.
	* Need handle change in objects, and to figure our what had changed and to
	make a database update call

Managing all of this is a maintenance pain.
