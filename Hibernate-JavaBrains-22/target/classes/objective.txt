Transient and persistent objects
--------------------------------

1.	Save a user to the database, and while the session is still open, change the user. What happens?
	Hibernate issues an update statement.
2.	When an object is persisted using the session, it becomes a persistent object.
	Before it's persisted it's a transient object.
3.	Hence, once you commit the transaction, the last state is what will be reflected to the database.
	More precisely, any change in between the begining to the end of the transaction is going to be ignored. Hibernate
	figures out the least number of updates.
4.	Once the session is closed, the object becomes detached. It is similar to transient object.
