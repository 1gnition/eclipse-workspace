Tomcat is the one who instantiates the Servlet objects, and also the request
and response objects. These objects are Tomcat's own implementation of the
specification. Every time a URL is accessed, a new Request and Response objects
are created. The servlet is not. Servlet objects are reused. A thread is assigned
to every request, and accesses the servlet.
HTTP is a stateless protocol. How do we make it stateful? We use sessions. Just
like Tomcat provides us a request object, it provides a session object.

	request.getSession();

What if we want an object that is persisted even through sessions?
We use Servlet context:

	request.getServletContext();
	
Thread are created per request, and run the servlet code (doGet(), doPost(), etc.)
