1.	Understand how to use inheritance with Hibernate
2.	Why do we have to use inheritance?
	2.1	For example, if UserDetails has a collection of abstract class Vehicle
		that can contain any of the Vehicle subclasses TwoWheelerVehicle and FourWheelerVehicle. Then to what table
		does the collection references? the two or four wheeler?
	2.2	Another reason - if we add a method to the superclass, then the subclasses inherit the method,
		but their tables lack a column 
		
Single-table inheritance
------------------------

3.	Create a vehicle class and two subclass and save them to the database
